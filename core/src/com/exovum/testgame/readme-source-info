The starting sample code in the package com.exovum.testgame is sample code created by RoaringCat games.
The starting code can be found here: https://github.com/RoaringCatGames/libgdx-ashley-box2d-example.
It is a smple of using libgdx, Ashley (an Entity Component System), and Box2D.
I do not claim to have created the code in this com.exovum.testgame package.
    [renamed from com.roaringcatgames.testgame to fit along with my other packages]
