#Ludum Dare 37

This is my starting code for Ludum Dare 37 and the warmup.
It is used as a way to get started with libGDX, Screens, Sounds, Ashley ECS, and maybe Box2d for physics.
 
##Sample Code

The starting code for this was based off of the
[libgdx-ashley-box2d-example](https://www.github.com/RoaringCatGames/libgdx-ashley-box2d-example)
created by [RoaringCatGames.](http://roaringcatgames.com/)
I used the code provided as a base.

The starting code can be found in the package [com.exovum.testgame](core/src/com/exovum/testgame)

Also, see [README-sample.md](README-sample.md) as the original README.
